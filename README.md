# IATD
Static website for the International Association of Traditional Drummers

<b>About the Project</b>

This was a project commissioned by a member of the IATD and a dear friend of mine. As a drummer and a member of the association since 2008, I was very excited to take on this project. IATD has little to no web presence and I am very excited to provide an informative resource to prospective and current members! 

<b>Development and Focus Areas</b>

For this website, I knew that I wanted a simple design that was focused on screen responsiveness and accessibility. The main demographic of users that would visit this site would be middle-aged to elderly people located in the United States. Because of user age, I focused on accessibility for those using technology such as screen readers, simple and to-the-point design so that there would be no confusion when navigating, and compatible with most browsers (because let’s face it - the majority of users will probably be using old versions IE!). 

<b>Languages and Frameworks Used</b>

I felt that Bootstrap 4 would be the best tool to utilize what I want to accomplish. I haven’t made too many projects with Bootstrap, because I really enjoy using vanilla CSS3, so it was to get a bit more involved with using this framework. 


This is pure HTML and CSS; no JavaScript, jQuery, or back-end languages of any kind. I also utilized Photoshop to create the banner and to mock-up a design for approval and as a reference.
